# Residual findings

Findings that are accepted but not yet fixed. The Definition of Done requires
this file to be current before each merge, so a known problem is a recorded
decision rather than something a future reader has to rediscover.

Each entry says what was found, why it was not fixed here, and what closes it.

## R-1. The commit hook is off by default on a fresh clone

**Found:** during U6 verification, 2026-08-01.

`scripts/scan_repo.py` is wired as a pre-commit hook and as a CI job. The hook
is the one that matters, because a personal literal or a credential that reaches
a commit is already in the history, and removing it is a rewrite every clone has
to follow.

The hook only exists after `pre-commit install` has run, and that command only
exists after pre-commit is installed. Both were README steps. On a machine where
pre-commit was not on the PATH, a planted personal path committed cleanly with
no hook and no warning. The guard was not weak, it was absent, and nothing said
so.

**Partly fixed here:** a `dev` extra now carries pre-commit, pytest, and ruff, so
`pip install -e '.[dev]'` makes the documented setup executable.

**Still open:** nothing verifies the hook is actually installed in a given clone.
Installing the tool is not the same as installing the hook.

**Closes when:** the doctor verb checks that `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists and
dispatches to this repository's configuration, and reports the exact command
when it does not. Doctor lands in U27.

## R-2. Four live portability and layering violations in the source repository

**Found:** during U6, while widening the guards. Confirmed independently against
the source at the lines given. Nothing in the source repository was changed.

These are recorded because Cratekit must not inherit them, and because two of
them are the exact blind spots the plan predicted the old guard had.

**Import direction, both masked by a lazy import:**

1. `src/dj_tools/DJ_common/routing.py:365` imports an analysis module from inside
   a function in the shared router. The router is domain-layer and the analysis
   module is a feature module, so this runs upward through the layering. The
   imported module pulls a numeric stack at module level, so a slim install
   raises on the first vocally routed track rather than at import, which is the
   worst place to discover it.
2. `src/dj_tools/DJ_common/sweep_prep.py:77` and `:126` import a feature module
   from a shared helper. This one is a genuine cycle, since that feature module
   imports four shared modules at module level. The laziness is what hides it.

Cratekit's `tests/test_layering.py` fails the build on either shape, so neither
can be ported in.

**Portability, in shipped skills the old guard could not see:**

3. A shipped skill document carries an absolute home-directory path. The old
   rule matched one volume literal only, so home directories were unchecked
   everywhere.
4. A second shipped skill carries a bare volume name with no path around it. A
   full-path match cannot see that shape at all.

Both are caught now: `scripts/scan_repo.py` covers every tracked path rather
than package source, and the bare-name tier plus the declared identity file
covers the second.

**Closes when:** the source repository is retired at the end of the migration.
These are not fixed there because it is the live system and this plan does not
change it. If any of these files is used as porting source, the violation is
fixed in the port, not carried across.

## R-3. The secret scan cannot read inside compressed archives

**Found:** during U6.

The scan skips binary content, so a credential inside a `.tar.gz` or `.zip` is
invisible to it. This matters concretely: the downloader artifact that gets
vendored currently sits in the same directory as a live session cache holding
OAuth tokens, an environment file holding service credentials, and a web token.

**Mitigated:** the scan flags credential-shaped *filenames* regardless of
content, so a credential store carried in by name is caught even when its bytes
are unreadable.

**Still open:** an archive whose *inner* paths carry a credential is not
inspected.

**Closes when:** the vendoring unit lands and the vendored tree is committed
unpacked, with its provenance recorded, rather than as an archive. Vendoring is
U13. If an archive must ship, the scan needs an archive-aware tier.

## R-4. Backup pruning reclaims space only if the remote is configured to

**Found:** during U35, porting the backup script.

The source system's prune passes a Google Drive option so the deleted archive
folders bypass the provider's trash and stop counting against the quota
immediately. Without it, on Drive specifically, a pruned folder keeps occupying
the quota for thirty days, which defeats the point of pruning on a library this
size.

**Not carried across, deliberately.** The remote is configuration now, and that
flag is meaningless on most providers and wrong on some. Baking a
one-provider option into a command built for every provider is the shape this
port exists to remove.

**Still open:** nothing tells a user of that provider to set the equivalent.
rclone supports the option per remote in its own configuration, so the setting
exists; what is missing is the prompt.

**Closes when:** the setup wizard asks, or doctor reports, that a remote whose
provider trashes on delete has the per-remote option set. Both land in U27.

---

## R-5. The backup restore is not yet bound to the destructive-session gates

**Found:** during U35.

A restore replaces a live rekordbox database and its sidecars. KTD24 binds the
library lock, the backup acknowledgment, and the volume identity assertion to
any operation that can destroy user data, whether or not it writes a database
row, and a restore is squarely one.

**Why it is not bound here:** the session boundary is U8 and is not present. The
verb is declared `destructive=True`, and the restore path already refuses on the
two conditions it can check alone: an unconfirmed decision and a live rekordbox
process.

**Closes when:** U8 lands. The dependency is registered in `tests/_pending.py`
against `cratekit.core.session`, and the guard there fails the build the moment
that module exists and the restore path is still unwired.

## R-6. Two verification gates for this unit need hardware this run did not have

**Found:** during U35 verification.

The plan's verification step for this unit is "one real backup run and a restore
rehearsal to a scratch directory". Neither ran end to end against a real remote.
A real backup needs a configured remote holding a copy of a library measured in
hundreds of gigabytes, and no such destination is configured on this machine;
the library volume is also read-only to this work by instruction.

**What did run:** every decision and every command the run would issue, against a
temporary directory with the command runner and the process probe injected, plus
the restore's sidecar-clearing order asserted on real files. The uncovered
surface is exactly one thing: whether rclone accepts the argument vectors this
builds.

**Closes when:** the author configures a remote and runs the backup verb once
with its dry run, then for real, and records the outcome. That is an attended
step, like the other live-hardware gates in this plan.
