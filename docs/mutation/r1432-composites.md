# Mutation table: r1432-composites

Measured by `scripts/mutate.py` on 2026-11-07 21:01 UTC, branch `cloud/630-a-finish-of-a-stopped-order-leav` at `ca3e2e5e`. Pass kind: light.

Baseline: green, 17493 collected. pytest invocations for this batch: 4.

Known failures: 161 node ids whose failure is this machine's and not the tree's, read from `.cloud-battery/baseline.txt` and subtracted from every run, the baselines and the rows alike. The baseline is green net of them, and a death among them is not counted. This is a Linux measure of a macOS suite; the full battery is owed on a Mac.

Environment: inherited from the calling shell, then added to. Added: PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1; PYTHONPATH (the plugin's temp directory, prepended); MUTATE_REPORT_PATH (the plugin's output file); the installation state sandbox: CRATEKIT_CONFIG_DIR, CRATEKIT_STATE_DIR, HOME, USERPROFILE, XDG_CACHE_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_STATE_HOME (all pointed inside the run's workspace, R-343). Removed: PYTEST_ADDOPTS (an inherited value would edit the command after the driver built it); PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER (the reporting plugin reads it to tell a worker from the controller, so a driver started from inside a parallel worker would hand its child a controller that believes it is a worker and writes no report; xdist sets it afresh in each worker the child starts); PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER_COUNT (the same inherited worker identity, scrubbed with it); PYTEST_XDIST_TESTRUNUID (the same inherited worker identity, scrubbed with it). Nothing else was scrubbed, because a hand built environment is how a missing binary reddens a baseline and every row after it.

Installation state: the watched roots are unchanged. Fingerprinted before the first child this run started and after every one of them: ~/.config/cratekit (0 entries); ~/.local/state/cratekit (2 entries). A change would have stopped the batch at the child that was running. Every child ran with its own throwaway installation state, so a test that undoes the suite's isolation lands there rather than on this machine (R-343). Only those roots are watched; the sandbox also redirects HOME and the data root, and a child reaching one of those is not seen by this guard.

Null control `NULL_CONTROL`: killed 0, collected 17493 against 17493. The control is a semantically empty change, so a zero here is what makes every other number in this table believable.

## Row definitions

### `C4_finish_reads_the_listing_unfinished`

what E4 holds: at a finish the readable tracks are read as the account lists them, with the stopped write's remaining moves not applied, so its half done order is read as the account's
