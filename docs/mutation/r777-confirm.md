# Mutation table: r777-confirm

Measured by `scripts/mutate.py` on 2026-10-08 04:52 UTC, branch `unit/issue265-sync-mark-reads-an-intake-file-a-native-` at `1e253f0`. Pass kind: light.

Baseline: green, 12740 collected. pytest invocations for this batch: 5.

Environment: inherited from the calling shell, then added to. Added: PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1; PYTHONPATH (the plugin's temp directory, prepended); MUTATE_REPORT_PATH (the plugin's output file); the installation state sandbox: CRATEKIT_CONFIG_DIR, CRATEKIT_STATE_DIR, HOME, USERPROFILE, XDG_CACHE_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_STATE_HOME (all pointed inside the run's workspace, R-343). Removed: PYTEST_ADDOPTS (an inherited value would edit the command after the driver built it); PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER (the reporting plugin reads it to tell a worker from the controller, so a driver started from inside a parallel worker would hand its child a controller that believes it is a worker and writes no report; xdist sets it afresh in each worker the child starts); PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER_COUNT (the same inherited worker identity, scrubbed with it); PYTEST_XDIST_TESTRUNUID (the same inherited worker identity, scrubbed with it). Nothing else was scrubbed, because a hand built environment is how a missing binary reddens a baseline and every row after it.

Installation state: the watched roots are unchanged. Fingerprinted before the first child this run started and after every one of them: ~/Library/Application Support/cratekit (257183 entries). A change would have stopped the batch at the child that was running. Every child ran with its own throwaway installation state, so a test that undoes the suite's isolation lands there rather than on this machine (R-343). Only those roots are watched; the sandbox also redirects HOME and the data root, and a child reaching one of those is not seen by this guard.

Null control `NULL_CONTROL`: killed 0, collected 12740 against 12740. The control is a semantically empty change, so a zero here is what makes every other number in this table believable.

## Row definitions

### `N4_plain_name`

Confirm: _native_proof takes a pass name no landing could have been given, after the test that pins its message

- File: `src/cratekit/sync/mark_cli.py`
- Surface: user
- Subset: test files importing cratekit.sync.mark_cli
- Ran: `tests/test_intake_imported.py`, `tests/test_intake_land_names.py`, `tests/test_sync_mark.py`
- Collected: 120 against a baseline of 120
- Kills: 1 (killed)
- Killed:
  - `tests/test_sync_mark.py::test_a_pass_name_no_landing_could_have_been_given_is_refused`

Old text:

```
    if not landing.plain_name(name):
```

New text:

```
    if False:
```

### `N7_digest_marks`

Confirm, the first table's old text was moved by the fix round: the native digest no longer covers the planned marks

- File: `src/cratekit/sync/mark_cli.py`
- Surface: user
- Subset: test files importing cratekit.sync.mark_cli
- Ran: `tests/test_intake_imported.py`, `tests/test_intake_land_names.py`, `tests/test_sync_mark.py`
- Collected: 120 against a baseline of 120
- Kills: 1 (killed)
- Killed:
  - `tests/test_sync_mark.py::test_a_native_answer_is_stale_once_another_playlist_becomes_whole`
