# Mutation table: u138-rerun

Measured by `scripts/mutate.py` on 2026-10-13 05:11 UTC, branch `fable/315-session-ack-without-terminal` at `a72c477a`. Pass kind: light.

Baseline: green, 13747 collected. pytest invocations for this batch: 4.

Environment: inherited from the calling shell, then added to. Added: PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1; PYTHONPATH (the plugin's temp directory, prepended); MUTATE_REPORT_PATH (the plugin's output file); the installation state sandbox: CRATEKIT_CONFIG_DIR, CRATEKIT_STATE_DIR, HOME, USERPROFILE, XDG_CACHE_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_STATE_HOME (all pointed inside the run's workspace, R-343). Removed: PYTEST_ADDOPTS (an inherited value would edit the command after the driver built it); PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER (the reporting plugin reads it to tell a worker from the controller, so a driver started from inside a parallel worker would hand its child a controller that believes it is a worker and writes no report; xdist sets it afresh in each worker the child starts); PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER_COUNT (the same inherited worker identity, scrubbed with it); PYTEST_XDIST_TESTRUNUID (the same inherited worker identity, scrubbed with it). Nothing else was scrubbed, because a hand built environment is how a missing binary reddens a baseline and every row after it.

Installation state: the watched roots are unchanged. Fingerprinted before the first child this run started and after every one of them: ~/Library/Application Support/cratekit (408201 entries). A change would have stopped the batch at the child that was running. Every child ran with its own throwaway installation state, so a test that undoes the suite's isolation lands there rather than on this machine (R-343). Only those roots are watched; the sandbox also redirects HOME and the data root, and a child reaching one of those is not seen by this guard.

Null control `NULL_CONTROL`: killed 0, collected 13747 against 13747. The control is a semantically empty change, so a zero here is what makes every other number in this table believable.
