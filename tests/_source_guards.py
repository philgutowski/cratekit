"""Source analysis shared by the guards that hold a LATER unit to what U11 settled.

Two files ask these questions, ``tests/test_review_queue.py`` and
``tests/test_cli_contract.py``, and they used to ask them with two copies of the
same walk. One copy learned to recognize an aliased import and the other did not,
which is the second opinion that eventually disagrees. There is one
implementation now, and every fixture that proves it bites lives beside it.

WHY THESE WALK THE IMPORT GRAPH RATHER THAN MATCHING A NAME. A guard that looks
for an attribute called ``offer`` is satisfied by any object in the language that
happens to have a method of that name, so a module that never touches the review
queue at all can pass it. A reviewer demonstrated exactly that: a file that hand
edits a gate column in a comma separated file, plus one unrelated ``.offer(``
call and one dead assignment, satisfied all three assertions of the countdown
meant to forbid it. So every question here is answered against the name the
source actually bound ``cratekit.core.review`` to, in whichever import shape it
used, and a call on anything else is not an answer.

THE OTHER DIRECTION MATTERS JUST AS MUCH (P7). A guard that fires on correct code
gets routed around, so each function accepts every import shape this repository
allows: the module imported whole, the module imported under another name, and a
symbol imported from it directly. ``tests/test_review_queue.py`` runs each one
against a correct fixture in both shapes AND against the evasion, because P7 says
to run a guard against correct code before shipping it and that half was the half
that was skipped.
